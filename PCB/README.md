<h1>Gerbers and eagle design files</h1>

Two versions of the board are available. One for high end ALPS faders (which are expensive and quite often out of stock) and another for lower cost Brouns faders (1/3 of the price and more readily available)

<h2>Mouser Carts :</h2>

These are complete carts to have all the parts to make the build. 
Resistors and capacitors very small so I stronly recommand ordering more (little tip: order resistors and capacitors amount and the next price break this will make you save a few cents)
