This is an hardware modified version of the original 16n. https://github.com/16n-faderbank/16n

Fully assembled unit with high end aluminium enclosure, high end faders and set of cables available @ https://schneidersladen.de/de/atovproject-16n-atovproject-rework

Bourns compatible PCBs Panels and cases are available @ https://pushermanproductions.com/product/16n-euro-version-pcb-and-anodized-aluminium-black-panel/

You can also contact me at info@atovproject.de if you want a ALPS compatible PCB/panel/case set. I will stock some from time to time.

<h2>The concept</h2>

The 16n Faderbank is aimed a solving a problem very specific to modular synthesis. As a patch is getting more and more complex a forest of cables has grown over your system before you know it. The 16n allows you to take the control from the modular into a very ergonomic controller that integrates perfectly into a modern studio.

The 16n is a faderbank sending CV, I2C, MIDI jack compatible with all standards, USB MIDI (compatible PC, Mac, iPad etc...) , making it the absolute ultimate controller for any of your hardware and software all in one! 

This unit was redesigned for a DIY workshop organised in the Berlin Modular community. The redesign was done following the wishes and desires of the community. The 16n AtoVproject redesign is the result of this initiative.

<h2>Modifications compared to the original are :</h2>

-Updated power section
  Isolated USB power supply. Proper voltage reference. Upgraded filtering.
    This greatly reduce the noise on the outputs. (Measured at less than 6mV)

-Selectable 5v or 10V outputs: Each can be configured to output either 10V or 5V using a dip switch on the back of the module (even when using 5V USB power supply)

-Outputs facing upwards: The outputs will be directly on the front panel reducing the footprint and making outputs much more accessible.

-Eurorack compatible: You would be able to mount the 16n as a 50hp module in your rack and power it from your own power supply. (+12V=42mA, -12V=0mA)

-The footprint of the jack is compatible for banana connectors! So you'll be able to use it with your Serge or Buchla system.

-I2C connector on the PCB to simplify connection to modules like the ER301

-Two versions of the board are available one with high quality ALPS faders and another one with Bourns mid range faders (1/3 of the price of the ALPS).

Based on original open source work by Brian Crabtree, Sean Hellfritsch, Tom Armitage and Brendon Cassidy. Circuit design update by AtoVproject aka Arthur Gibert

As stated by the original designers the original 16n folows a CC-BY-SA licence therefore the 16n AtoVproject is and will always remain entirely open source following the same licence.

If you are making modification to this design, you must correctly credit everyone involved in the initial version, and also share your own changes with the similar license. So you can’t make a fork of 16n or the 16n AtoVproject redesign that you don’t open-source yourself.
