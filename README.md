This is an hardware modified version of the original 16n. https://github.com/16n-faderbank/16n

Bourns compatible PCBs Panels and cases are available @ https://pushermanproductions.com/product/16n-euro-version-pcb-and-anodized-aluminium-black-panel/

You can also contact me at AtoVproject (at) gmail.com if you want a ALPS compatible PCB/panel/case set. I will stock some from time to time.

<h2>The concept</h2>

The 16n Faderbank is aimed a solving a problem very specific to modular synthesis. As a patch is getting more and more complex a forest of cables has grown over your system before you know it. The 16n allows you to take the control from the modular into a very ergonomic controller that integrates perfectly into a modern studio.

The 16n is a faderbank sending CV, I2C, MIDI jack compatible with all standards, USB MIDI (compatible PC, Mac, iPad etc...) , making it the absolute ultimate controller for any of your hardware and software all in one! 

As one of the Berlin Modular community organisers, I decided to make a redesign of the 16n faderbank following the suggestions and desires of our members. The 16n Berlin Modular Edition is the result of this collaboration.

<h2>Modifications compared to the original are :</h2>

-Updated power section
  Isolated USB power supply. Proper voltage reference. Upgraded filtering.
    This greatly reduce the noise on the outputs. (Measured at less than 6mV)

-Selectable 5v or 10V outputs: Each can be configured to output either 10V or 5V using a dip switch on the back of the module (even when using 5V USB power supply)

-Outputs facing upwards: The outputs will be directly on the front panel reducing the footprint and making outputs much more accessible.

-Eurorack compatible: You would be able to mount the 16n as a 50hp module in your rack and power it from your own power supply. (+12V=42mA, -12V=0mA)

-The footprint of the jack is compatible for banana connectors! So you'll be able to use it with your Serge or Buchla system.

-I2C connector on the PCB to simplify connection to modules like the ER301

-Two versions of the board are available one with high quality ALPS faders and another one with Bourns mid range faders (1/3 of the price of the ALPS).
