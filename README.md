<h1>16n Berlin Modular Edition</h1>

This is an hardware modified version of the original 16n.

<h2>The concept</h2>
The 16n is a fader bank sending CV, I2C, MIDI jack compatible with all standards, USB MIDI (compatible PC, Mac, iPad etc...) , making it the absolute ultimate controller for any of your hardware and software all in one!

<h2>Modifications compared to the original are :</h2>

-Updated power section
  Isolated USB power supply. Proper voltage reference. Upgraded filtering.
    This greatly reduce the noise on the outputs. (Measured at 6mV)

-Selectable 5 or 10V outputs: Each outputs will have a jumper on the back allowing you to decide whether this output sends 10 or 5V (even when using 5V USB power supply)

-Outputs facing upwards: The outputs will be directly on the front panel reducing the footprint and making outputs much more accessible.

-Eurorack compatible: You would be able to mount the 16n as a 50hp module in your rack and power it from your own power supply.

-The footprint of the jack is compatible for banana connectors! So you'll be able to use it with your Serge or Buchla system.

-I2C connector on the PCB to simplify wirering to modules like the ER301

-Changed the slider model to a BOURNS due to a shortage of ALPS sliders (both version of the board will be available)
